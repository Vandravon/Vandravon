- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vandravon!
- 👀 I’m interested in web dev!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and SQL!
- 💻 I prefer Front-End. JS is not easy for me but I keep going!
- 💞️ Now I'm pretty shy and trying to get better, but I hope I can collaborate on Web small projects later!
- 📫 How to reach me: Github only (I hope I'll add more!)
