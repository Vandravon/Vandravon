- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vandravon!
- :disappointed_relieved: Smoll beginning, smoll code...
- 👀 I’m interested in web dev!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS!
- 💞️ Now I'm pretty shy and trying to get better, but I hope I can collaborate on Web small projects later!
- 📫 How to reach me: Github only (soon I'll add more!)
